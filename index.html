    <h1> High-school hikers </h1>
    <h2> A View from the top </h2>
    <p> Hello and welcome to our whole class blog on hiking! </p>
    <p> We have just had a fun-filled day in the Brecon Becaons which included an exciting climb to the top of Pen-Y-Fan. </p>
    <p> We had fun cimbing up to the top and looking at the view, which was amazing. </p>
    <p> We also had a few funny moments like how a sheep was just blocking the path and bahhing at us, it was quite funny. </p>
    <p> And once we got to the top, we stayed there for a little before heading back down. It was very fun! </p>
